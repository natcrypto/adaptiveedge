    category: 'Strategic Transformation',
    challenge: 'How do you evaluate the future-readiness of a massive global business that spans multiple business models across all global regions?',
    approach: `Over 14 months, in collaboration with Treehouse Innovation, the team worked alongside 85 senior leaders from Freudenberg's C-suite and VP levels, representing all 11 strategic business units. The challenge was to assess the future readiness of the company through deep research sessions and interviews exploring every facet of their operations.

The culmination was a four-day event bringing together 450 key participants. But this wasn't a typical corporate event. Complex strategic findings needed to be presented in ways that were clear, emotionally engaging, memorable, and even entertaining. The approach centered on helping people connect with the material on a personal level, to feel involved rather than simply informed.

Key interventions included an interactive six-room gallery where each room was dedicated to one of Freudenberg's guiding principles, with interactive quizzes, games, and historic artifacts. Breakout sessions used creative formats like a Formula One-themed board game for operational excellence, and a risk compliance game where participants earned "Freudenbugs" by solving real-world challenges while providing valuable feedback to the risk team.

A magician was brought in whose craft served as a metaphor for organizational transformation, and an orchestra performance that demonstrated the power of collaboration. Animated videos broke down complex governance and compliance models into visually compelling narratives.`,
    impact: `The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Participants left not only informed but energized, having engaged with strategic material in surprising and enjoyable ways. Leadership gained new perspectives from participant insights, which shaped their approach to risk, compliance, and operational excellence.

The resources and tools created continue to serve as lasting assets, allowing Freudenberg to communicate and embed these strategic updates across their vast global organization. This case demonstrates the power of combining strategic depth with creative engagement to ensure lasting impact.`,

    challenge: 'How can we align and engage employees with our strategy in the face of significant industry shifts?',
    approach: `Sandvik Coromant, a global leader in the metal cutting sector, needed their Offer Management and Research & Development teams to be more deeply connected with the company's long-term goals. Working with Treehouse Innovation, the work began with comprehensive research, gathering insights from employees and customers to inform strategic decision-making.

This led to a meticulously planned one-and-a-half-day strategic forum in Sweden, where the OM R&D leadership came together to co-develop their 'Future State for 2030'. This wasn't just an event—it was a strategic forum designed to foster collaboration, strategic thinking, and vision alignment. Through thoughtfully curated activities, leaders immersed themselves in the insights gathered, using them to shape a collective vision of the future.`,
    impact: `The leaders left united and aligned, with a clear shared understanding of the 'Future State for 2030'. This shared vision marked the beginning of an ongoing dialogue about how the business will work together to achieve its aims. The initiative represented a pivotal moment of strategic advancement, with leaders returning energized and equipped to drive the collective vision forward, embedding the newly formed strategic insights into their daily operations.`,

    challenge: 'How can we help a culture of innovation to spread across 600 leaders in a fast-paced, competitive market?',
    approach: `In collaboration with Treehouse Innovation and Sky's head of learning and development, an innovation programme was built and rolled out for all 600 Sky leaders. Every aspect of the learning experience was designed to suit Sky's culture, starting with design sprints to deeply understand the need, appetite for innovation, and perception of creativity.

Initial designs were prototyped and user-tested to ensure everything felt intuitive and matched Sky's culture. The two-day programme enabled a real culture of innovation and creativity to spread. It involved engagement with real customers and a challenge for business leaders to come up with ideas to improve the business—one of which inspired the creation of Sky Glass.

The programme also featured an assessment of leaders' own team culture of innovation, identifying ways they could better support their teams.`,
    impact: `The programme achieved the highest Net Promoter Score any programme at Sky has ever received. Leaders went on to use the tools and processes with their teams to empower them to take more risks, test assumptions, and engage customers when developing new offerings. This work inspired Sky to create its own internal Labs team, which was then supported to master facilitation of design workshops.`,

    challenge: 'How can we scale up our internal innovation capability by training facilitators from across the business?',
    approach: `Following the success of the Better Innovation programme, Sky set up Sky Labs—its own internal innovation function—to help teams use innovative mindsets and approaches to solve problems. To grow the team, collaboration with Treehouse Innovation led to the creation of a curriculum to scale up capability and bring other people from across the business into the team as facilitators.

A brand new one-day session was created featuring activities to teach new facilitators the skills and approaches needed to run sessions with colleagues. This included facilitation cards with tips and personas they'd encounter (senior stakeholders, reluctant participants), followed by roleplays to practice leading different types of people.

Participants were given the chance to practice running sessions and receive feedback from peers and facilitators. The session also included 'Design Improv'—using improv theatre methods with design to build on people's spontaneity in creative mode.`,
    impact: `The session received fantastic feedback, and the Sky Labs team went on to use the skills and techniques to bring on new recruits, successfully scaling their internal innovation capability and ensuring consistent, high-quality facilitation across the organization.`,

    challenge: 'How can Sky\'s People Partner team better serve their internal customers in an ever-changing, fast-paced marketplace?',
    approach: `Sky\'s People Partner team works as internal consultants, connecting leaders across the business with tools to solve problems. They wanted to better serve their internal customers. Working with Treehouse Innovation and True & North, their Client-centred Thinking methodology was delivered—using design thinking, neuroscience, and behavioral economics.

An all-day in-person session was run for 35 people from different levels of the business with different internal clients. Together the group explored a three-step process they could apply: Care (building real empathy through research and observation, using anchor questions), Co-create (exploring solutions together using client-centred understanding), and Consensus (planning for what could go wrong through premortem exercises).

The success of the People Partner team depends on establishing trust among Sky\'s leaders, so this client-centred approach was vital to demonstrate value and keep support in-house.`,
    impact: `The team received really positive feedback, with people immediately starting to think about anchoring questions for their clients. One director went out of her way to share how the session helped them reframe their approach with tricky stakeholders. The session equipped the team with practical tools to build trust and drive more effective conversations across the organization.`,

    challenge: 'How can we improve our healthcare provision to better meet patient needs in an increasingly challenging operating environment?',
    approach: `Following COVID-19, staff shortages and inflation made operating in US healthcare more challenging than ever. With rising costs, it was vital that patients felt their needs were being met. In partnership with Treehouse Innovation and Experience Point, the team worked with a healthcare organization looking to become more patient-centric in decision making.

Two concurrent sprints were run on Sprintbase, focusing on primary care and breast care. Using design thinking, every step of patients' journeys was mapped and explored, then ideas for improvement were developed. The team spoke with extreme users—patients registered for different lengths of time, people undergoing chemotherapy, recent breast cancer diagnoses—working closely with the healthcare team through inevitably sensitive discussions.

Based on these conversations, pain points were identified in primary care (waiting times, billing, reception interactions, medication access) and breast care (test results communication, treatment waiting times, opportunities to ask questions post-diagnosis). Positive feedback was also heard about clinicians and care professionals.

Virtual workshops were run to brainstorm improvements, then 50 people—including senior stakeholders and decision makers—were brought together for a two-day in-person workshop in New York. These interactive sessions gave people the opportunity to speak directly with patients about their experiences.`,
    impact: `Having patients take part had a real impact. Hearing directly how frightened someone was to receive a cancer diagnosis, or how they felt hearing the news alone at work, resonated deeply with people. It demonstrated that talking to patients isn't intimidating and showed the power of direct human insight. The organization continues to iterate ideas developed during these projects, working toward more patient-focused care.`,

    challenge: 'How can we take a more customer-centric approach to our work across a global pharmaceutical organization facing multiple industry challenges?',
    approach: `AstraZeneca created 'Our future reimagined', a global transformation programme to help overcome challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry—from increased digital technology use to supply chain changes. The programme aimed to help the organization become more patient-centred, use data smartly, and ensure system alignment.

Working with Treehouse Innovation, a series of two-day workshops were run with teams responsible for each programme area to accelerate their understanding of design thinking and its application. With one team, exploration focused on how the supply chain process could be improved, looking at a regular scenario for clinical trials—making decisions about medication in bottles and distribution (label information, container capacity, crate distribution).

Through conversations with supply chain colleagues, the team gathered invaluable human insight: people playing key roles in getting medication to patients weren't being considered early enough in the process. This led to logistical issues and blame for delays that could have been avoided through earlier engagement. It became clear that supply chain colleagues really cared about patients and felt left out of decisions. Using role play, the team was helped to work out how to collaborate better.`,
    impact: `This led to new requirements integrated into Merlin—a system for controlling the whole clinical process. It's now been changed to allow for everybody's voices to be heard, ensuring supply chain considerations are incorporated early in the process, reducing delays and improving outcomes for patients.`,
